    <h1>Dear Dad,</h1>
    <p>I know things have been a bit tense lately, but I want you to know how much I appreciate you and everything you do. Your hard work and dedication to our family mean the world to me. I'm grateful for your guidance, support, and the countless sacrifices you make for us. I hope we can find a way to talk things through and make things better. You are an incredible father, and I love you very much. ðŸ’–</p>
